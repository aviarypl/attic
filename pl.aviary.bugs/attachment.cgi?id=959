People who aren't afraid of recompiling the nvidia kernel module or
even reinstalling the nvidia driver each time the kernel has been
updated and want or need to use the latest and greatest nvidia driver
can use the following steps 1-3. The others should use the
instructions above using YaST and skip the steps below.

1) Kernel sources must be installed and configured. Usually this means
installing the 'kernel-source', 'make' and 'gcc' packages with YaST2. 

2) Use the nvidia installer for 1.0-9629.

 sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9629-pkg1.run -q
 
3) Configure X.Org with

 sax2 -r -m 0=nvidia (0 is a digit, not a letter!)

NOTE: There is no need to try to enable 3D support. It's already
      enabled, when the nvidia driver is running.

IMPORTANT: You need to recompile and install the nvidia kernel module
           after each kernel update.

 sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9629-pkg1.run -K
